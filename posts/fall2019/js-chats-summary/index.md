### What is JavaScript Chats?

> “After you learn JavaScript, you should learn more JavaScript”

Learning a language or a framework outside of class can be hard, especially past the syntax and the standard APIs. JavaScript is one of the most popular languages that people use outside of academic settings at UCLA. Come out to JavaScript Chats with ACM Hack, a weekly discussion on intermediate/advanced JavaScript. This series aims to deepen your understanding of the language’s features and designs. We also plan to cover frameworks related topics.

### Session 1: Function and this

In this section, we learn about the functions and the 
`this` pointer in JavaScript. As a dynamic language, it 
introduces a lot of convenience but also pitfalls when 
it comes to scoping. We will also see how ES6 syntax 
helps us avoid these pitfalls.

Before going into this section, make sure you know:
- How to write a function with the function keyword and the arrow function syntax in JavaScript
- What are Arrays and Objects in JavaScript?
- The existence of `this` keyword in JavaScript

See the session note here: [Function and this](/posts/fall2019/js-chat-1/)

### Session 2: Asynchronous JavaScript

We will take a tour of asynchronous programming in JavaScript. We will talk
about the eventloop, the underlying components within the JavaScript engine
that drives the asynchronous programming model. We will also talk about
`Promise`s.

### Session 3: A Gentle Introduction to React Hooks

In React 16, the library introduced a new paradigm to code React application
called "hooks". We will help you transition from the class based syntax to
the new hook pattern. We will also discuss the motivation behind the switch
and how we “share logic” with React hooks!

Make sure you know basic React before going into this.

### Session 4: Optimizing Frontend and React Apps

How do we optimize our webpage? We will focus on measuring the performance of a web application with the Chrome DevTools. We will also learn some techniques to optimize the performance of our React application.

### Session 5: Multi-Threading in JavaScript: Worker Threads 

JavaScript is traditionally single-threaded. The idea of multi-threading is
recently introduced to the language in both the browser and Node runtime. We
will talk about how to utilize your CPU in a language with a primarily single
thread model, and how threads communicate and pass data to each other.
